What is Project Euler?

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.


Each Program contains:
- runnable c++ program with functionality implemented as a funtcion
- runtime of the program
- function to test the program
- appropriate comments included in the code, and
- screenshot for output attached herewith in png format.



Why you chose the problems:
I chose the following problems because:
a. they were an interesting exercise.
b. wanted to make sure the code was testable and requirements were very clear
c. I chose one easy problem and two moderately medium ones so I could optimize the code as much as possible

Time taken:
Research on questions, selection of questions:  2 H
Algorithms, code logic and implementation: 6 H
Code Test strategies and implementation: 2 H
Commenting and final submission: 30 mins
